# Hello-World
This is my first step in the 1000 mile journey
# Hobbies and Likes
I like to joke about jogging sometimes. Reading some books that are amazing like, *A Tale of Two Cities*, *Crime and Punishment. Creating beats is quite something. Kendrick Lamar's type of music making is what I find **insane**
Taking a walk is a good way of relaxing while at the same time enjoying views.
